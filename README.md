Key Takeaways:

Python and SQL dominate in demand, showing up in hundreds of job listings.

While R is also highly demanded, it offers slightly lower average pay compared to newer technologies.

High-paying but less common tools like Go, Looker, Scala, and GCP suggest that specialized or cloud-based skills are financially rewarding.

Libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and Snowflake are associated with salaries above $150K, indicating their value in advanced analytics and machine learning.

Data engineering tools (e.g., Spark, Databricks, Snowflake) are in moderate demand but offer very competitive salaries.

This data helps pinpoint which skills offer the best balance between market demand and salary potential for remote roles.
